# lcars-sounds
These are sounds from Star Trek only some sounds you may need more or even less for your happiness. I will also leave some URLs to places to get files and even pics too. Please know this: I do not have anything to do with any of these. Use at your own risk. I don't mean that they are bad/evil/full of viruses or other baddies type, I just am not a contributer there.
